This project includes:

- Data cleaning
- Static visualization for EDA
- Text wrangling
- Dynamic dashboarding with Shiny

> Due to the size of the data set, storing data inside a CSV and render a html which contains all data is highly impractical. The loading time of a self-contained html could be extremely long.
